![ScreenShot](https://alex-tou-portfolio.netlify.app/images/video-chat/masthead.jpg)

This is a one-on-one video chat app similar to the public chat website Omegle. The only difference is, you don't pair up randomly with strangers. Instead, you call the person you want to chat with by giving them your provided unique ID.

This app was built with ReactJS using WebRTC and SocketIO. SocketIO is responsible for creating a private room for both users using the recipient's ID and the communication aspect of the app. WebRTC is used to display a video/audio stream to the end user.# Install packages
